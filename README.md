# E-WASTE LOCATOR APP

<details>
  <summary>Introduction</summary>

  Imagine a world where responsible e-waste disposal is not just a choice but a seamless and rewarding experience. Our project is your gateway to this reality. We've designed an innovative web app that identifies devices, locates e-waste centers, educates users, and rewards eco-conscious actions. Let's revolutionize e-waste management together.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Architecture</summary>

  Users interact with the app on their devices, which sends requests to a web application. The web app handles user accounts, points, and device identification, and can use external services like mapping. A web server serves the app, and a database stores user data, facility info, and content. External services help with translation and mapping. Physical e-waste facilities are part of the system too.

  <summary>Proposed Methodology</summary>

  Addressing the pressing issue of E-waste, our solution educates users on proper disposal. We integrate an E-waste facility locator, promoting responsible disposal. A rewards system incentivizes users, with points redeemable during future electronic purchases. Our innovation is a user-friendly scanning feature, aiding those unfamiliar with tech. It identifies devices and educates users on precious metal composition, ensuring a seamless experience.

  <summary>Design Aspect</summary>

  - Simple, visually appealing and easy navigation to key features device scanning, nearest e-waste centers, educational resources, and user profiles.
  - The homepage presents information in clear and concise aesthetic cards and sections, ensuring users stay engaged.
  - We've included impactful images, essential facts, and "did you know" sections in a striking color to educate users on e-waste's environmental impact.
  - A prominent CTA button guides users to the education page, offering in-depth information, disposal tutorials, and further exploration.
  - Our educational resources also highlight a three-pronged sustainability approachâ€”covering environmental, economic, and social responsibilities.
